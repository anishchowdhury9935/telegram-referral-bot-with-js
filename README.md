BOT_TOKEN=<your_bot_token_form_bot_father>
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
ADMIN_ID=<admin_id> means admin user_id

/reset command will be only accessible by admin so ADMIN_ID is important
admin id is nothing but the user_id of the user which will be the admin
so /reset command can be runed by only admin
